// This file rewrites Windows host paths to the /mnt/<drive> paths where
// the WSL2 guest automounts each drive. The functions parse plain strings
// instead of using path/filepath, whose rules follow the build platform,
// so they behave the same everywhere and their tests run on every
// platform. Callers apply them only on Windows. Only the hostCwd and
// hostDriveCwd hooks ask the host, and tests replace both.
